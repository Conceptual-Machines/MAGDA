# The MAGDA Manifesto

## Software should adapt to the user

Creative tools shape the way music is made.

For decades, digital audio workstations have grown more powerful, but also more rigid, more complex, and more tightly bound to the assumptions they were built on. Workflows have accumulated around legacy decisions, customization has remained limited, and too often musicians are forced to adapt their process to the tool rather than shaping the tool to fit their process.

MAGDA was created from a different starting point.

We believe creative software should adapt to the user — not the other way around. A digital audio workstation should not prescribe a single workflow, a fixed interface, or a narrow way of thinking about music. It should be a flexible system that can be reshaped, extended, and reprogrammed to match the way each person works.

In a world where creative practices evolve quickly and workflows differ radically from one artist to another, adaptability is not an optional feature. It is the foundation.

From that foundation, MAGDA is built as a programmable, inspectable, and evolving platform — designed to remain open to change rather than frozen in time.

## Customization as a creative primitive

At the core of MAGDA is the idea that customization is not a luxury, but a fundamental creative capability.

Scripting, modular routing, explicit signal flow, reversible workflows, and deep automation are not advanced features added on top of a finished product. They are the structure of the system itself. They allow musicians, engineers, and researchers to shape the tool around their ideas instead of bending their ideas around the tool.

A modern digital audio workstation should not be a fixed product.

It should be a system:

- programmable at every level
- modular by default
- inspectable by design
- capable of evolving with its users

MAGDA exists to explore what becomes possible when a DAW is treated not as an application, but as a creative platform.

## Intelligence as automation, not replacement

Artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming part of every creative workflow. This is both an opportunity and a responsibility.

MAGDA treats intelligence primarily as an automation and advisory layer.

The goal is not to replace musicians, composers, or engineers. The goal is to remove friction: to automate repetitive tasks, accelerate exploration, surface useful suggestions, and make complex systems easier to reason about.

Creativity remains human.

Intelligence exists to serve it.

The system is here to help you work, not to work instead of you.

Where generation and creation overlap, those boundaries should remain visible and controllable. Users should understand what the system is doing, be able to intervene, and remain fully in control of the result.

## Open foundations, sustainable innovation

MAGDA is built on the belief that the foundations of creative tools should remain open, extensible, and auditable.

Open systems are more resilient.
They encourage experimentation.
They reduce lock‑in.
They allow communities, educators, and researchers to participate directly in shaping the future of creative software.

At the same time, sustainable development requires real engineering, long‑term maintenance, and room for innovation. Open foundations and proprietary services are not opposites — they are complementary layers of a healthy ecosystem.

Our goal is to keep the core flexible and accessible, while building advanced tools responsibly on top of it.

## Open, but principled

MAGDA is open to experimentation, extension, and new ideas — but not without direction.

A flexible system still needs a clear philosophy. While the platform is designed to welcome new features, workflows, and contributions, it is also built around a small set of deliberate design principles: adaptability over prescription, programmability over hard‑coding, transparency over opacity, and human control over automation.

Not every idea belongs in the core.

Features that contradict these principles — that introduce lock‑in, hide critical behavior, fragment workflows, or reduce user agency — are intentionally out of scope. Coherence matters as much as openness. A system that accepts everything eventually stands for nothing.

MAGDA is therefore open by design, but opinionated by intent. Growth is guided not by feature count, but by alignment with the philosophy that the tool should adapt to its users, remain inspectable, and empower creative control.

---

## Against lock‑in and creative monopolies

As creative workflows become more intelligent and more automated, the risk of centralization grows.

Closed formats, opaque engines, and proprietary automation systems do more than limit choice — they shape creative culture itself. When tools become impossible to inspect, extend, or migrate away from, innovation slows and users lose agency.

MAGDA is built to resist that future.

Projects should remain portable.
Workflows should remain inspectable.
Automation should remain programmable.

Creative software should empower its users, not trap them.

---

## A system, not a product

MAGDA is not designed as a single finished application.

It is designed as a platform:

- modular by default
- programmable at every level
- reversible by design
- extensible by the community
- intelligent by assistance, not by replacement

Live performance workflows, deep modulation, routing, automation, scripting, and intelligent assistance are not separate features — they are different expressions of the same underlying system.

MAGDA exists to explore what a digital audio workstation can become when it is built deliberately, from first principles, for the workflows of the next decade.

---

## Building in the open, moving fast

MAGDA is developed with the belief that creative tools must evolve continuously.

Modern software development makes it possible to iterate faster, experiment more freely, and build systems that would have taken years in the past. Open development allows these ideas to be tested early, shaped by real users, and improved collaboratively.

MAGDA is built in public not because it is easy, but because it is the best way to build something that lasts.

---

## Our promise

MAGDA will always aim to be:

- human‑centered
- programmable
- transparent
- resistant to lock‑in
- open at its core
- intelligent by automation, not by authorship

We are not building a tool to automate music.

We are building a system to amplify human creativity.
